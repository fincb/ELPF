# Expected Likelihood Particle Filter

This repository contains a WIP (Work In Progress) Python implementation of an Expected Likelihood Particle Filter for state estimation.

## Overview

Currently, the repository contains a Bootstrap Particle Filter, which is used for estimating the state of a moving object based on noisy measurements in a range-bearing format. This implementation includes classes for managing states, particles, and the particle filter algorithm.
